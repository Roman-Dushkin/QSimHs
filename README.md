QSimHs is a library for simulation of quantum computing, written in Haskell. It is designed to provide researchers, students and developers with a flexible and efficient tool for simulating quantum circuits and algorithms.

The library consists of several modules, including a kernel module, which consists of a set of modules defining the basic primitives used in quantum computing, such as qubits, quantum gates, quantum states, etc. Several modules are available to define well-known quantum algorithms such as Deutsch, Grover, Yogi, Shore and Simon algorithms, making it easy to implement these algorithms and study their behaviour. Modules describing the problem-oriented programming language Quipper provide an intuitive way to represent quantum circuits and algorithms.

The library is designed to be user-friendly and efficient. It is optimised for performance, enabling users to model large and complex quantum circuits quickly and accurately. At the same time, it is easy to use, with a clear and intuitive set of modules that simplify the creation, manipulation and analysis of quantum circuits.

The QSimHs library is designed for students, researchers and developers to learn quantum computing techniques.
